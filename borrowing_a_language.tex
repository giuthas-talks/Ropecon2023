\frame{\frametitle{Land acknowledgement}
We wish to acknowledge and honor the Miami, Delaware, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and
Shawnee people, on whose ancestral homelands I have worked on this presentation.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Notes on content}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I want to keep this a safe space of mutual respect.
  \item There will be discussion of topics such as colonization, oppression,
  pejoratives, etc. in this presentation.
  \item The workshop part that starts in about an hour is free of such content
  on my part. 
  \end{itemize}  
}

\frame{\frametitle{Other Housekeeping}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Please feel free to ask questions at any point.
    \item There will also be time for discussion and questions afterwards. I do
    not intend to fill the full 45 mins with just me talking.
    \item However, we may end up using the discussion time during the
    presentation.
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{column}{5cm}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Pertti Palo
      \item I've got a couple of degrees (loosely speaking) in engineering.
      \item I've also got a PhD in Phonetics.
      \item I have no formal qualifications in Borrowing a Language, but I do
      know a lot about speech production, and\ldots
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
} 

\frame{\frametitle{I do have some background}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I am not a text linguist but rather a phonetician and a speech
  researcher.
  \item When I say 'language' I mainly mean spoken language today. 
  \item Besides a speech researcher with 20+ years of experience, I've been an
  RPG enthusiast for 30+ years. 
  \item Recently I've also started training as an oral storyteller which has
  some interesting connections with RPGs and science.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{What lead me here?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item It all started with wanting to improve D\&D. 
  \item No, not the current one, the 1980's one. 
  \item Anyhow, I also had some very nice (Finnish) magazines (Magus) with good
  adventures that I wanted to combine into an open ended campaign and for some
  reason decided against running it in any Known World\ldots 
\end{itemize}

}
\frame{\frametitle{Announ (my world -- and multiverse)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item First drawn to the requirements of my campaign idea.
  \item Later expanded with help from
  the old world building mailing list (hello 90's), the MythoPoet sheets, and the
  excellent "Top Down and Bottom Up world designing"~article. 
  \item I stole a good deal of the coast lines from real world maps by tracing
  them on tracing paper.
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{\frametitle{People's and languages of Announ}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Quite early on I figured that while emulating J.R.R. Tolkien is all fine
  and dandy, I wanted to be able to run the game next week rather than in the
  next life.
  \item So, instead of designing my own languages from scratch, I decided to use
  existing ones. 
  \item I already had access to three and had heard somewhere, or more probably
  read in the LotR, about language family trees and such. 
  \item The players were Finnish, so it was an easy choice to choose that as the
  majority language for the initial area of adventuring and off I went with
  that.
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Tentative principles for choosing languages I}

Don't take or use what is not yours -- at least not without permission.
\begin{itemize}
  \item In private -- i.e. if you are not publishing -- you can use (almost)
  whatever.
	\item It's still a good -- and even a useful -- idea to remember that real
	world languages come with people, culture, physical and social environment,
	and history attached to them.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Tentative principles for choosing languages II}
In public, get permission:
\begin{itemize}
  \item This probably rules out a lot of the ready made constructed
  languages.
  \item It also means that if the community who's language you are about to use
  is in some way vulnerable -- especially colonised or oppressed, you should get
  permission from the community.
  \item Major languages are probably a safer bet in this way, but let's be aware
  that dialects and languages are a fluid thing and some dialects effectively
  come with the same challenges as vulnerable languages.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Tentative principles for choosing languages III}
So what to borrow then? It depends on (at least):
\begin{itemize}
\item The above considerations
\item Do you want chronological consistency?
\item Do you mind mixing regular languages and constructed ones?
\item What's the world like?   
\end{itemize}
And\ldots
}

\frame{\frametitle{Tentative principles for choosing languages IV}
How do thse factors mesh with the story you/we want to tell?
\begin{itemize}
\item Do you want to match like for like? Norse spoken by Viking-like folks,
Latin by the dominant empire?
\item How about the environment? A lot of language is concerned with weather,
climate, vegetation, animals, and land forms. And speech may be affected by
environmental factors.
\item What sort of historical relationships between communities do the
languages reflect?
\item Howabout contrasting with history as it happened? Technologically advanced
Aztec speakers in an otherwise medieval world where something like modern
English is used by the less advanced people?
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{What we'll do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Work as one or more groups with a maximum of 6 in total.
  \item I'll introduce the story seeds.
  \item We'll have about 25 minutes for working on a story as the whole group or
  stories in smaller group.
  \item In interest of keeping to the schedule, each group will work on only one
  story seed.
  \item We'll end with a very quick sharing and feedback in the last 20 mins.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The seeds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dragon speech and physics (such as they are) and the consequences to the
  world or story.
  \item Humanoids who do not use sound as a means of communication (and possibly
  can not perceive it).
  \item The base code of reality being a spoken (/speakable) programming
  language.
  \item Social and/or physical environment of speech and language in a world or
  story.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Some ideas to play around with}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the world is magical, language can be too: 
  \begin{itemize}
    	\item Unholy, vowel rich language (cf. Moorcock): hääyöaie (i.e. you can
    	do this with Finnish)
    	\item "Guttural, evil language" was not a great idea to start with.
  \end{itemize}  
  \item Homophone words (think 'for' and 'four') and homonyms (see
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym} for details) and other plays on words
  can be part of a story ("Pedo mellon a minno.")
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mix this with dialects and you can produce a pretty solidly confusing
    situation.
    \item Working these into game play may not be the easiest though.  
  \end{itemize}
  \item Whistled languages
  \item Singing
\end{itemize}
}
